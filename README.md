# Overview

This repository provides a **fully reproducible implementation** of Louis Bachelier's seminal 1900 doctoral thesis,

> **Théorie de la Spéculation**

widely recognized as the **foundation of modern quantitative finance**.

Developed by **Alpha Stochastic Research (ASR)**, this project reproduces the principal mathematical results of Bachelier's work using modern computational methods. It includes numerical simulations, theoretical verification, Python implementations, publication-quality figures, and a corrected LaTeX edition of the original manuscript.

The objective is to preserve one of the most influential contributions to financial mathematics while promoting **open science**, **reproducible research**, and **quantitative education**.

# Numerical Results

## Arithmetic Brownian Motion

The repository reproduces Bachelier's arithmetic stochastic process

```math
P_t = P_0 + \sigma W_t
```

using **5,000 Monte Carlo trajectories**.

### Validation

| Property | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Martingale Property | ✅ Verified |
| Maximum Mean Error | **0.037** |
| Variance Scaling Error | **1.56 %** |
| Negative Prices | Theoretically possible (not observed in simulation) |

---

## European Option Pricing

Implementation of Bachelier's closed-form pricing formula

```math
C=(P_0-K)\Phi(d)+\sigma\sqrt{T}\,\phi(d)
```

where

```math
d=\frac{P_0-K}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}
```

### Validation

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Closed-form vs Monte Carlo (2M paths) | ✅ Error = **0.0008** |
| ATM √T Scaling | ✅ Exact |
| Comparison with Black–Scholes | ✅ Maximum Difference = **0.0048** |
